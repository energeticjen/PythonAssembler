	that all source files are in the same folder, and that the 
	save path is correct for your system. To change the save path, 
	copy the path from the file directory, making sure to use double
	slashes; ex: "\\".
	The basic program text file has been included. If another program
	is going to be used, make sure to change the "document" variable
	to match; ex: "basic".
